# Inspiration
We wanted to create a desktop application that can analyze someone's tweets and determine if you are a positively or negatively connotated person. We thought that this would be a great project to work on during our winter break, but then school came around and we ceased development (until we resume again ofc).

# What It Does
Upon opening the application, you will come across a beautifully-themed UI (default PyQt application) where you wil be prompted with a single-line text field to input a public Twitter handle. Upon submission, our program will fetch the URL associated with the handle, execute a NLP algorithm to deduce the twitter profile's connotation, and create multiple visualizations detailing the most commonly used words and, obviously, if the profile is positive or negative. Pretty sick huh?

# What's Next for our Twitter Scraper
It is not in operating condition at the moment, but we hope to continue development in the near future. We would love to see it reach a point where we can give it any Twitter handle, produce our desired results (perfectly or very close to perfect), and possibly even deduce if a stock will rise or fall (if given the twitter profile of a CEO of a company).

# What We Learned
Development during winter break is difficult when everyone is preparing for interviews, school, and Winter hiring season. Yay college students. Also, Python is extremely powerful. It was very fun using it and we hope to learn more in the near future.
